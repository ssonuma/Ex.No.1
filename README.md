## Introduction :

Generative Language Models gained signiﬁcant attention in late 2022 / early 2023, notably with the introduction of models reﬁned to act consistently with users’ expectations of interactions with AI (conversational models). Arguably the focal point of public attention has been such a reﬁnement of the GPT3 model - the ChatGPT and its subsequent integration with auxiliary capabilities, including search as part of Microsoft Bing. Despite extensive prior research invested in their development, their performance and applicability to a range of daily tasks remained unclear and niche. However, their wider utilization without a requirement for technical expertise, made in large part possible through conversational ﬁne-tuning, revealed the extent of their true capabilities in a real-world environment. This has garnered both public excitement for their potential applications and concerns about their capabilities and potential malicious uses. This review aims to provide a brief overview of the history, state of the art, and implications of Generative Language Models in terms of their principles, abilities, limitations, and future prospects – especially in the context of cyber-defense, with a focus on the Swiss operational environment.


One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top 10% of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom 10%.

## Generative AI : 
  
   
  Generative AI is an emerging sub-domain of AI that is revolutionizing the use of technology as we know it. Its ability to generate new and unique content has great potential as a knowledge assistant, although it is still in the exploration phase. Instead  of  simply  classifying,  analyzing,  or  processing  existing  data, Generative AI attempts to generate new data that resembles the original and  is  indistinguishable  from  that  created  by  humans.  To  achieve  this, Generative  AI  models  use  deep  learning  techniques,  neural  networks, and other advanced AI techniques to create models that can learn and replicate patterns in large datasets. 
      

Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning (ML) to produce new content from an extensive training dataset. The format of the result can be text, images, video, code, 3D renderings, or audio. Nowadays, when we interact with a search engine like Google or when we use a traditional question-answer  chatbot,  we  are  requesting  existing  information.  In  contrast, when using generative AI-based tools, the model is using existing information to generate original content, such as songs, poems, articles, etc. Two  flagship  models  that  have  put  Generative  AI  in  the  general  public conversation are ChatGPT and DALL-E. ChatGPT is a chatbot that can generate original text and DALL-E can create original images, both from a text input or “prompt.” 1 According to Gartner, by 2025 generative AI will be responsible for producing 10% of the data, compared to less than 1% currently 1 . The organization behind these two models is OpenAI, a research and development company  based  in  San  Francisco,  California.  Due  to  the  high  popularity  of ChatGPT,  the  company  has  already  launched  a  paid  subscription  pilot  called ChatGPT+ and closed a deal with Microsoft to license and commercialize the model within its suite of corporate products. 
    

 Other models similar to OpenAI’s GPT include: • Bloom: a text generation model in 46 languages and 13 programming languages with 176 trillion parameters, created by the BigScience project, a collective of more than 1,000 researchers from 60 countries. •  LLaMA,  a  “smaller”  text  generation  model  with  between  7  and  65  trillion parameters,  from  MetaAI  that  requires  less  computational  power  than  larger models. The  interesting  thing  about  the  technology  behind  Generative  AI  is  that  we cannot  predict  the  content  it  generates,  it  is  completely  original  and  unique content, with reasoning that is becoming increasingly close to that of a human. Despite  these  advances  in  technology,  and  how  useful  it  may  seem  for  our day-to-day lives, we must remember that it is a kind of knowledge assistant. It assists us in generating content, but it cannot make decisions for us, nor should we base our decisions solely on what is generated by engines like ChatGPT. It should also be noted that not all generated content is correct, the technology used can provide inadequate responses. 



## Applications of Generative AI:

 
Image  generation: the  model  can  generate  a  collection  of  original  images based on a detailed description such as environment, subject, style, or location. Some  available  tools  include  OpenAI’s  DALL-E 4 and  Stable  Diffusion. 5 In another case of image generation, the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) method can convert a low-resolution image into a high-resolution image. 6 This application can be useful in the healthcare sector for patient diagnosis, as well as for security and surveillance purposes. For instance, this method is beneficial for  creating  top-notch  versions  of  medical  resources  that  are  not  feasible  to store  in  high-resolution  format  due  to  cost  constraints. 7 On  the  editing  side, Google Pixel’s Magic Eraser 8 feature uses generative AI to automatically remove unwanted photograph elements and fill in space.


Text generation: the model can generate original text based on a description. For  example,  an  article,  an  essay,  a  script,  a  summary  of  a  specific  topic,  etc. One of the most well-known examples is ChatGPT, where the model can hold a conversation and generate relevant content based on the context of the search. However, these models are still in development and present multiple challenges to generate reliable information to be used without prior verification. 

   
Audio generation: the model can generate original audio based on text or even  from  another  piece  of  audio.  For  example,  it  could  create  audio  training based  on  notes  for  the  education  sector,  as  well  as  generate  narration  using the same voice as the reference audio. Lastly, the model can generate musical pieces  based  on  a  large  set  of  data.  However,  this  application  will  have  to overcome  copyright  legislation    to  be  able  to  use  the  training  data  of  other musical  artists.  For  instance,  Google  Duplex 9 is  a  virtual  assistant  in  a  spoken format capable of understanding the person one is talking to almost perfectly, answering practically as a human. It can support call centers. 


 Video generation: the model can detect time and space in videos to generate a  new  sequence.  This  model  could  be  used  to  identify  anomalies  in  security and  surveillance  videos  as  it  can  identify  the  probability  of  new  sequences. Meta’s Make-A-Video 10 and Runway Research’s Gen-1 11 are two publicly available applications that show advances in technology. 


Synthetic  data  generation: the  model  can  generate  a  type  of  data  called “synthetic,”   which   is   artificially   generated   and   not   derived   from   direct observations  in  the  real  world.  This  application  is  particularly  interesting  as  it preserves  the  privacy  of  the  owners  of  the  data  used  to  train  the  model.  This application could be used in the healthcare sector to generate and analyze data for disease research while preserving patient privacy. 


3D modeling generation: the model can generate 3D versions based on 2D images or text. With this method, a “digital twin” can be built in the meta-verse as part of the creation of virtual worlds. Some applications could include training for  the  construction,  manufacturing,  or  healthcare  sectors,  as  well  as  city  and physical product design. 





HEIM: Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models:


The rapid progress of AI text-to-image systems has prompted the development of more sophisticated evaluation methods. In 2023, Stanford researchers introduced the Holistic Evaluation of Text-to-image Models (HEIM), a benchmark designed to comprehensively assess image generators across 12 key aspects crucial for real-world deployment, such as image-text alignment, image quality, and aesthetics.9 Human evaluators are used to rate the models, a crucial feature since many automated metrics struggle to accurately assess various aspects of images. HEIM’s findings indicate that no single model excels in all criteria. For human evaluation of image-to-text alignment (assessing how well the generated image matches the input text), OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 scores highest. In terms of image quality (gauging if the images resemble real photographs), aesthetics (evaluating the visual appeal), and originality (a measure of novel image generation and avoidance of copyright infringement), the Stable Diffusion–based Dreamlike Photo real model ranks highest.

## General Reasoning:


General reasoning pertains to AI systems being able to reason across broad, rather than specific, domains. As part of a general reasoning challenge, for example, an AI system might be asked to reason across multiple subjects rather than perform one narrow task (e.g., playing chess).


Artificial Intelligence (AI) reasoning refers to how AI models process information, draw conclusions, and make decisions. The reasoning process in AI can be categorized into different approaches, depending on the architecture and purpose of the model.

Symbolic vs. Statistical Reasoning
AI reasoning can be broadly classified into two major paradigms:

a. Symbolic Reasoning (Rule-Based AI)
Based on logic and explicit rules defined by humans.
Uses if-then rules and knowledge bases to infer conclusions.
Examples: Expert systems, decision trees, and Prolog-based AI.
Limitation: Struggles with uncertainty and unstructured data.

b. Statistical Reasoning (Machine Learning & Deep Learning)
AI learns patterns from data instead of relying on pre-defined rules.
Uses probability and statistics to make predictions or generate responses.
Examples: Neural networks, Large Language Models (LLMs), Bayesian networks.
Advantage: Can handle complex, real-world problems with large datasets.
Limitation: Lack of explainability and interpretability in decision-making.



## Key Reasoning Methods in AI

a. Deductive Reasoning (Top-Down Approach)
AI applies general rules to reach specific conclusions.
Example: 
oRule: "All birds can fly."
oFact: "A sparrow is a bird."
oConclusion: "A sparrow can fly."
Used in: Expert systems, theorem proving, and formal logic AI.

b. Inductive Reasoning (Bottom-Up Approach)
AI learns patterns from specific examples and generalizes them.
Example: 
oObserving that "Most birds can fly" from real-world data.
oAI infers a general rule instead of assuming it outright.
Used in: Machine learning and data-driven AI models.

c. Abductive Reasoning (Inference to Best Explanation)
AI infers the most likely cause based on given evidence.
Example: 
oObservation: "The ground is wet."
oPossible causes: "It rained" or "Someone watered the plants."
oAI determines which is the most probable explanation based on past data.
Used in: Medical diagnosis, anomaly detection, and decision support systems.

Best practices for a safe and responsible use of generative AI tools :
When  using  generative  AI  Tools,  users  should  ensure  their  interaction  is  not only productive but also ethical and accurate. These guidelines are designed to provide responsible usage:

1.Validate and verify the accuracy of the generated content, we recommend to  verify  any  source  quoted  by  Artificial  Intelligence.  The  primary  purpose  of Generative AI is to create new and original content, sometimes this content can be inaccurate or biased. As such it should not be used as a primary and single source of information since outputs could be unreliable or based on outdated information. 

2.Do  not  use  non-public  or  confidential  information  until  your  organization has  identified  and  approved  compliant  tools.  Some  Generative  AI  public tools  store  and  use  the  information  you  share  to  enrich  the  model,  and  it  will become  available  to  other  users.  We  recommend  to  not  share  personal  data and be mindful of potential privacy breaches that could arise through indirect identification of individuals.

3.Ask  questions  to  the  tool,  when  possible,  about  how  conclusions  were reached. Embrace ongoing learning and training to understand the capabilities and limitations of these tools and apply them responsibly in the work environment. 

4.Be  mindful  of  any  biased  data  that  can  lead  to  inaccurate  outcomes  or discrimination. Make sure that the generated content you share is aligned with your organization’s values.

5.Be aware of Intellectual Property Rights. These tools extract and generate information  taking  into  account  multiple  sources,  and  the  content  generated might not be copyright free.

## Large Language Models :

 Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks and beyond. This success of LLMs has led to a large influx of research contributions in this direction. These works encompass diverse topics such as architectural innovations, better training strategies, context length improvements, fine-tuning, multi-modal LLMs, robotics, datasets, bench-marking, efficiency, and more. With the rapid development of techniques and regular breakthroughs in LLM research, it has become considerably challenging to perceive the bigger picture of the advances in this direction. Considering the rapidly emerging plethora of literature on LLMs, it is imperative that the research community is able to benefit from a concise yet comprehensive overview of the recent developments in this field. This article provides an overview of the existing literature on a broad range of LLM-related concepts. Our self-contained comprehensive overview of LLMs discusses relevant background concepts along with covering the advanced topics at the frontier of research in LLMs. This review article is intended to not only 
provide a systematic survey but also a quick comprehensive reference for the researchers and practitioners to draw insights from extensive informative summaries of the existing works to advance the LLM research.

Language plays a fundamental role in facilitating communication and self-expression for humans, and their interaction with machines. The need for generalized models stems from the growing demand for machines to handle complex language tasks, including translation, summarization, information retrieval, conversational interactions, etc. Recently, significant breakthroughs have been witnessed in language models, primarily attributed to transformers, increased computational capabilities, and the availability of large-scale training data. These developments have brought about a revolutionary transformation by enabling the creation of LLMs that can approximate human-level performance on various tasks.

A broader overview of LLMs, dividing LLMs into seven branches: 1. Pre-Training 2. Fine-Tuning 3. Efficient 4. Inference 
5. Evaluation 6. Applications 7. Challenges




## Architecture of LLM:

LLMs are primarily built upon the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. The Transformer model significantly improved the ability to process and generate text compared to previous architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks.
a. Transformer Architecture
The Transformer model is composed of multiple stacked layers of encoders and decoders. However, LLMs such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) typically use only the decoder portion of the Transformer.
Encoders: Used in models like BERT, they process entire input sequences at once, capturing contextual relationships between words.
Decoders: Used in models like GPT, they generate output sequences one token at a time, predicting the next word based on prior context.

Key Components of Transformer-Based LLMs
a. Tokenization
Before processing text, LLMs convert words into smaller units called tokens. Tokenization methods include:
Word Piece (used in BERT)
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) (used in GPT)
Sentence Piece (used in T5)
Each token is then mapped to an embedding vector for input into the model.



b. Embedding Layer
The token embeddings are numerical representations that preserve semantic meaning. They are combined with positional encoding, which allow the model to understand word order.

c. Self-Attention Mechanism
Self-attention is the core mechanism that allows LLMs to determine the importance of words in a sequence. It works as follows:
Assigns Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors to each token.
Computes attention scores to weigh the significance of different words.
Enables the model to focus on relevant words while processing input.

d. Multi-Head Attention
This technique allows the model to learn different aspects of relationships between words by using multiple attention heads. Each head captures distinct dependencies and nuances in language.

e. Feedforward Layers
Each Transformer layer contains a fully connected feedforward network, which applies non-linear transformations to improve feature representation.

f. Layer Normalization & Residual Connections
To stabilize training and improve gradient flow, LLMs use layer normalization and residual connections, which help maintain efficiency in deep architectures.


Training Process of LLMs
Training an LLM involves two major phases:
a. Pre-training
LLMs are initially trained on vast datasets using self-supervised learning.
Common objectives include:
Masked Language Modeling (MLM) (used in BERT)
Causal Language Modeling (CLM) (used in GPT, predicting the next word sequentially)
b. Fine-tuning
Once pre-trained, models can be fine-tuned on domain-specific or task-specific datasets to improve performance in areas like sentiment analysis, medical diagnostics, or coding assistance.

Computational Considerations
Training and running LLMs require significant computational resources:
High-performance GPUs / TPUs for parallel processing.
Large-scale distributed computing to handle billions of parameters.
Optimization techniques like gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training to reduce memory usage.

 ## Examples of Architecture

## General Purpose LLM:



T5 : T5 places layer normalization outside the residual path in a conventional transformer model. It uses masked language modeling as a pre-training objective where spans (consecutive tokens) are replaced with a single mask instead of separate masks for each token. This type of masking speeds up the training as it produces shorter sequences. After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned using adapter layers for downstream tasks. 



GPT-3 : The GPT-3 architecture is the same as the GPT- 2 but with dense and sparse attention in transformer layers similar to the Sparse Transformer. It shows that large models can train on larger batch sizes with a lower learning rate to decide the batch size during training, GPT-3 uses the gradient noise scale as in. Overall, GPT-3 increases model parameters to 175B showing that the performance of large language models improves with the scale and is competitive with the fine-tuned models.



mT5 : A multilingual T5 model trained on the mC4 dataset with 101 languages. The dataset is extracted from the public common crawl scrape. The model uses a larger vocabulary size of 250,000 to cover multiple languages. To avoid over-fitting or under-fitting for a language, mT5 employs a data sampling procedure to select samples from all languages. The paper suggests using a small amount of pre-training datasets, including all languages when fine-tuning for a task using English language data. This allows the model to generate correct non-English outputs. 



PanGu-α : An autoregressive model that has a query layer at the end of standard transformer layers, to predict the next token. Its structure is similar to the transformer layer but with an additional embedding for the next position in the attention mechanism.


LLaMA : A set of decoder-only language models varying from 7B to 70B parameters. LLaMA models series is the most famous among the community for parameter efficiency and instruction tuning.

 

LLaMA-1 : Implements efficient causal attention by not storing and computing masked attention weights and key/query scores. Another optimization is reducing the number of activations recomputed in the backward pass.



LLaMA-2 : This work is more focused on fine-tuning a safer and better LLaMA-2-Chat model for dialogue generation. The pre-trained model has 40% more training data with a larger context length and grouped-query attention. 



PanGu-Σ : An autoregressive model with parameters copied from PanGu-α and extended to a trillion scale with Random Routed Experts (RRE). RRE is similar to the MoE architecture, with distinctions at the second level, where tokens are randomly routed to experts in a domain instead of using a learnable gating method. The model has bottom layers densely activated and shared across all domains, whereas top layers are sparsely activated according to the domain. This training style allows extracting task-specific models and reduces catastrophic forgetting effects in the case of continual learning.

## Challenges and Future Directions :


LLMs such as GPT-4 and its predecessors have significantly advanced natural language processing. Nevertheless, they also bring along a set of challenges. The computational cost, adversarial robustness, and interpretability are among the technical challenges that are intrinsic to these models. Furthermore, as these models are scaled up to handle more complex tasks or to operate in more complex or dynamic environments, new challenges in scalability, privacy, and real-time processing emerge. On the frontier of foundational research, integrating multi-modality and the effectiveness of transfer learning are being keenly explored. Additionally, the continuous learning aspect of these models, which aims to have models that can adapt to new information over time, presents a fresh set of challenges. These challenges not only underscore the technical intricacies involved but also highlight the broader impact and the future trajectory of LLMs in real-world applications. The following sections delve into these challenges, shedding light on the on going and potential efforts to address them. 


Computational Cost: 

Training LLMs requires extensive computational resources, which increases production costs and raises environmental concerns due to substantial energy consumption during large-scale training. Improved performance occurs as computational resources increase, but the rate of improvement gradually decreases when both the model and dataset size remain fixed, following the power law of diminishing returns. 


Bias and Fairness: 

LLMs can inherit and amplify societal biases in their training data. These biases can manifest in the model’s outputs, leading to potential ethical and fairness is Sues.

 
Overfitting: 

Although LLMs possess substantial learning capabilities, they are susceptible to overfitting noisy and peculiar patterns within their extensive training data. Consequently, this may cause them to generate illogical responses. The debate about Memorization vs. Generalization in LLMs is about finding the right balance. Memorization allows the model to remember specific details from its training data, ensuring it can provide accurate answers to precise questions. However, generalization enables the model to make inferences and produce responses for inputs it has not seen before, which is essential for handling various real-world tasks. Striking the right balance is the challenge: too much memorization can lead to overfitting, making the model inflexible and struggling with new Inputs.

 
Economic and Research Inequality:

 The high cost of training and deploying LLMs may make their development concentrated within well-funded organizations, potentially worsening economic and research inequalities in AI.

 
Reasoning and Planning:

 Some reasoning and planning tasks, even as seemingly simple as common-sense planning, which humans find easy, remain well beyond the current capabilities of LLMs evaluated using an assessment framework. This is not entirely unexpected, considering that LLMs primarily generate text completions based on likelihood and offer no solid guarantees in terms of reasoning abilities.

 
Hallucinations:

 LLMs exhibit “hallucinations", where they generate responses that, while sounding plausible, are incorrect or do not align with the provided information. The hallucination can be categorized into three categories. 

• Input-conflicting hallucination, wherein LLMs produce content that diverges from the input given by users. 
• Context-conflicting hallucination, where LLMs generate content that contradicts information they have generated 
earlier. 
• Fact-conflicting hallucination involves LLM’s generation of content that does not align with established world knowledge. 


Prompt Engineering: 

Prompts serve as inputs to LLMs, and their syntax and semantics play a crucial role in determining the model’s output. The prompt variations, sometimes counter intuitive to humans, can result in significant changes in model output and are addressed through prompt engineering, which involves designing natural language queries to guide LLMs responses effectively



Limited Knowledge:

Information acquired during pretraining is limited and may become obsolete after some time. Retraining the model using updated data is costly. To generate factually accurate responses people use a retrieval augmentation pipeline. However, pre-trained models are not trained with retrieval augmentation generation (RAG), hence, adapting the training pipeline is necessary. 


Safety and Controllability: 

Using LLMs comes with the risk of generating harmful, misleading, or inappropriate content, whether by accident or when given specific prompts. Ensuring these models are safely utilized is a significant concern. 



Multi-Modality: 

Multi-modal learning, where LLMs are trained on diverse data like text, images, and videos, aims to create models with richer understanding but faces challenges 
in data alignment, fusion strategies, and higher computational demands.











Adversarial Robustness: 

Large Language Models (LLMs)  have shown great capabilities in various tasks but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where slight, deliberate input alterations can mislead them. Especially with models like BERT, adversarial fine-tuning can enhance robustness, although it sometimes compromises generalization [476]. As LLMs integrate more into complex systems, examining their security properties becomes crucial, given the emerging field of adversarial attacks on LLMs within trustworthy ML [477].This vulnerability is notable in safety-critical domains, necessitating robust adversarial evaluation tools to ensure LLM reliability [478]. 



Interpretability and Explainability: 

The "black-box" nature of LLMs poses challenges in understanding their decisionmaking, which is crucial for broader acceptance and trust, especially in sensitive domains. Despite their advanced capabilities, the lack of insight into their operation limits their effectiveness and trustworthiness [479, 480]. Efforts are being made to make LLMs more explainable to promote user trust and to ensure responsible AI usage. Understanding the logic behind LLMs’ responses is essential for fostering trust and ensuring they align with human values and legal standards. 


Privacy Concerns: 

Privacy concerns in Large Language Models (LLMs) have escalated with their growth in complexity and size, particularly around data sharing and potential misuse. There is a risk of malicious content creation, filter bypass, and data privacy issues, especially in e-commerce, where protecting customer privacy is crucial. If models are trained on private data, additional concerns arise if such models are made publicly available. LLMs tend to memorize phrases from their training sets, which an adversary could exploit to extract sensitive data, posing a threat to personal privacy [481, 482].
 






Real-Time Processing:

 Real-time processing in Large Language Models (LLMs) is pivotal for various applications, especially with the rising popularity of mobile AI applications and concerns regarding information security and privacy.However, LLMs often have hundreds of layers and millions of parameters, which impede real-time processing due to the high computational demands and limited weight storage on 
hardware platforms, particularly in edge computing environments [483]. While certain efforts like MobileBERT aim to reduce memory requirements, they still face substantial execution overhead due to the large number of model layers, leading to high inference latency. 


Long-Term Dependencies:

 Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown considerable progress in understanding and generating text, yet they often struggle with preserving context and handling long-term dependencies, particularly in complex, multi-turn conversations or long documents. This limitation can lead to incoherent or irrelevant responses. 


Hardware Acceleration:

 The growth of LLMs presents significant hardware challenges due to the increasing computational and memory demands associated with training and deploying these models. GPUs have played a crucial role in meeting the hardware requirements for training LLMs, with the networking industry also evolving to optimize hardware for training workloads. However, the growing size of LLMs, which has been outpacing hardware progress, makes model inference increasingly costly. Model quantization is a promising approach to bridge the widening gap between LLM size and hardware capacity [484]. Although specialized hardware acceleration like GPUs or TPUs can significantly reduce the computational cost, making real-time applications more feasible, they may not fully resolve all limitations, necessitating further advancements 
in hardware technology. 





Regulatory and Ethical Frameworks:

The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have given rise to sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google’s Bard. These developments underscore the imperative for regulatory oversight to manage the ethical and social challenges accompanying LLMs’ widespread use. For instance, LLMs can generate content that can be used positively or negatively, emphasizing the need for proactive ethical frameworks and policy measures to guide their responsible use and assign accountability for their outputs. Auditing is identified as a promising governance mechanism to ensure that AI systems, including LLMs, are designed and deployed ethically, legally, and technically robust.
